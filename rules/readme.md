# How to compile spreadsheet decision table into compiled rules(aka executable rule model)
Rule executeable model is fast to load and running because it has pre-comipled into java bytecode before running. 

This project is original generated by exporting a project in business-central.

You have to add the following to enable rules compiled into byte code since by default exporting project from Business central, there is no drools-model-comiler included:

```xml
    <!--This is required for compile execution model-->
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.drools</groupId>
      <artifactId>drools-model-compiler</artifactId>
      <version>7.39.0.Final-redhat-00005</version>
    </dependency>  
```

## Run 
```
mvn clean package -DskipTests |tee b.log
```

You can notice in the b.log, the rules has been compiled into java byte code, hence they can be loaded directly by JVM classloader.

# Summary
Precompile Big table rules improve the performances; 
For 10K rules, fire one rule cost 200~250 millseconds time;
For 100k rules, fire one rule costs about 9000+ millseconds time;

The compilation takes very long time due to large amounts of java code being generated;
for 10k rules, Pre-Compilation takes 1.5 minutes
For 100k rules, it takes 5+ minutes;
Maven parallel compilation doesn't work due to kie-maven-plugin is not thread safe;
